# Sign & Speak — Product Design Overview

This document turns the functional prototype into a world‑class, accessible experience for two audiences:

- Child (Leo, 6): A magical, rewarding, game-like world that’s instantly intuitive.
- Parent (Sarah): A calm, insightful dashboard with quick wins and clear next steps.

## Goals
- First Rewarding Session for Leo in under 3 minutes: choose avatar, start Today’s Adventure, finish a micro‑module, earn a reward.
- Weekly Check‑in for Sarah in under 2 minutes: see summary, glance at trend, read one tip.
- WCAG 2.1 AA throughout; mobile‑first; tablet‑optimized for child.

## Core Journeys
- Child: Character Login → Today’s Adventure → 3‑minute Module → Reward (badge + confetti + sticker) → Back to Map.
- Parent: Login → Dashboard Summary → Trend graph → Suggested Tip/Resource → Optional Deep Dive.

## Experience Principles
- Cheerful, gentle magic for kids; calm confidence for parents.
- Instant feedback and positive reinforcement (no stress, no timers).
- Clear affordances; icon‑first for child, labeled text for parent.
- Progressive disclosure for data; never overwhelm.

## Success Criteria
- Child: completes a module unaided; smiles at reward; returns next day.
- Parent: understands progress at a glance; feels hopeful; takes one suggested action.
