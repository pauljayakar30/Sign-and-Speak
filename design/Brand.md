# Brand Identity

## Name & Tone
- Sign & Speak — friendly, empowering, hopeful.

## Logo
- Simple logomark: interlocking hands forming a speech bubble.
- Colors: child primary (#FF6B6B) + parent primary (#2F80ED).

## Mascot — Otter
- Cheerful otter who guides adventures and celebrates wins.
- Expressive but gentle; large eyes, rounded shapes; avoids overstimulation.
- Used prominently in child UI (home, module coach, rewards) and sparingly in parent UI (empty states, tips).

## Usage
- Keep layouts airy; avoid clutter.
- Use encouraging copy (“You did it!”, “Great job!”, “Try again—almost there!”).
- The otter’s speech should be short, positive, and optionally mirrored as text captions for accessibility.
